MyEun.e is a class file, where much of the library's low level functions are hidden.
They can be found in "minieun.e" and "myeunumber.e"

"*Exp" suffix functions are functions with an exponent.
"Eun*" prefix functions are functions that use an Eun datatype.

Eun datatypes contain 4 to 6 parts:
[1] number array (numArray)
[2] exponent (exp)
[3] target length (targetLength)
[4] radix (radix)
(5) optional, rounded up or rounded down
(6) optional, precision in radix of 2 (prec)
