Light side, or Dark side. I have chosen Light side, 
and I will receive no money for my programming work. 
I am just a hobbyist. Be a philanthropist with your 
money, as I am not receiving it.
 
The Light side and Dark sides of the force don't 
understand each other.  Dark side would make money, 
Light side has little use for money.
 
"More money more problems."  I would request that 
you donate the money I would have received from my 
software to charity.
 
It may not be the wisest decision, but it is the 
easiest choice I could make.
